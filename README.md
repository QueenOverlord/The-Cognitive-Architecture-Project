# The Cognitive Architecture Project: A Public Research Journal
**Status:** Active Research | **Lead Researcher:** [Polliana Pavloski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polliana-pavloski/ )

> [!summary] Mission Statement
> This repository is an open, public research journal dedicated to exploring and operationalizing the paradigm of **"Prompting as Cognitive Architecture."** Our central hypothesis is that we can achieve a step-change in AI performance by designing prompts that apply specific *cognitive pressures*, shaping *how* an AI thinks, not just *what* it thinks about. This project aims to transform this theory into a practical, actionable framework for professionals.

> [!note] **A Note on Our Mission: From Academic Theory to a Professional's Playbook**
> The powerful techniques discussed here—Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Self-Critique—are the groundbreaking work of researchers at institutions like Google, Princeton, and Stanford. **We did not invent these methods.**
>
> So, what is our contribution?
>
> **We are translating academic breakthroughs into a practical playbook for the modern professional.**
>
> While AI researchers know *what* these techniques are, most business users and developers are left asking, "This is great, but how and when do I actually *use* it?" They are given the engine of a rocket ship without the manual.
>
> **This project aims to provide that manual.** Our work is to:
> 1.  **Categorize:** We organize these powerful techniques into a clear, actionable framework based on the *type of problem* you need to solve (The Prompt Strategy Matrix).
> 2.  **Explain the "Why":** We introduce the concept of "Cognitive Pressure" as a mental model to understand *why* a certain technique works for a certain task.
> 3.  **Empower the User:** Our goal is to empower developers, analysts, marketers, and managers to move beyond simple prompting and start architecting reliable, high-quality AI outputs with intention and confidence.
>
> We stand on the shoulders of giants to build a ladder for everyone else.

## 1. The Core Idea: From Instruction to Architecture

This project is built on a fundamental paradigm shift in how we interact with Large Language Models.

- **[[concepts/Prompting as Cognitive Architecture|► Read the Core Thesis: Prompting as Cognitive Architecture]]**

This foundational note explains the shift from "Prompting as Instruction" (telling the AI what to do) to "Prompting as Cognitive Architecture" (designing a thought process for the AI to follow). It is the "why" behind this entire project.

## 2. The Foundational Knowledge Base

To understand the architecture, one must first master the building blocks. This section contains the core, evergreen notes that form the technical foundation of this research.

- **[[concepts/The Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering|► Level 1: The Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering]]**
  - *A consolidation of the non-negotiable first principles for crafting any effective prompt: Role, Task, Context, and Format.*

- **[[concepts/Advanced Prompt Engineering|► Level 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering]]**
  - *A dossier of advanced techniques, including Chain-of-Thought, Self-Critique Loops, and Tree of Thoughts, categorized by their strategic purpose.*

## 3. The Tactical Framework: The Prompt Strategy Matrix

Theory is useless without application. This framework is the bridge between the conceptual and the practical. It provides a system for diagnosing a problem and selecting the optimal prompting strategy.

- **[[concepts/The Prompt Strategy Matrix|► Access the Field Manual: The Prompt Strategy Matrix]]**

This note introduces a powerful diagnostic tool: The Four Cognitive Domains (Generation, Transformation, Extraction, Reasoning). It serves as a decision-making matrix for any real-world prompting task.

## 4. The Research Lab: Experiments & Evidence

This is where theory is tested. This section will contain the detailed logs of controlled experiments designed to validate (or invalidate) the hypotheses of this project. Each experiment will document the prompts used, the raw outputs, and an analysis of the results.

- **[[experiments/002-Creative-Generation-Test|► Experiment 002: The Creative Generation Test (Tree of Thoughts Validation)]]** `(Status: Pending)`
- **[[experiments/003-Self-Critique-Loop-Test|► Experiment 003: The Refinement Test (Meta-Cognition Validation)]]** `(Status: Pending)`
